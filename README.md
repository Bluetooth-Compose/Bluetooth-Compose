### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Those familiar with docker-compose.yml files will very likely already assume that a bluetooth-compose.yml file does something similarly very special.

### bluetooth-compose.yml
```
version: '0.1'

devices:
     breaths_per_minute:
        yardy-yardy: something
        etcetera:

     pulse_beats_per_minute:
        yardy-yardy: something
        etcetera:

logging:
        yardy-yardy: something
        etcetera:
```

We are a group of bluetooth-nutters who want to use yaml to not just automate the reading of bluetooth devices, but also to simulate devices to make integration testing easier.

And for example, can you imagine feeding an Apple Watch or Android watch with a bluetooth-compose.yml file and have it act as a Personal Bluetooth Hub to monitor a user's personal local bluetooth devices, and forward those readings to an app or cloud?

We can!

We've registered the following domains, and engaged a graphic artist to create the logo:

- bluetooth-compose.com
- bluetooth-compose.net
- bluetooth-compose.org
- bluetooth-compose.co.uk

We're just getting started but you can email us at super.admin@bluetooth-compose.com if you are at all enthusistic about this!
